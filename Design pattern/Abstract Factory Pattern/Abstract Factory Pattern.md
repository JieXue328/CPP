### Intent
* Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms", and the construction of a suite of "products".
* The new operator considered harmful.

* AbstractFactory：抽象工厂
* ConcreteFactory：具体工厂
* AbstractProduct：抽象产品
* Product：具体产品
