Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. 
This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact

Decorator pattern is one of the **structural patterns**.
