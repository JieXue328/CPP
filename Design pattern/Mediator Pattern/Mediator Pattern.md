### Intent
* Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
* Design an intermediary to decouple many peers.
* Promote the many-to-many relationships between interacting peers to "full object status".

#### Previous

If we were to model this in software, we could decide to have User objects coupled to Group objects, and Group objects coupled to User objects. Then when changes occur, both classes and all their instances would be affected.
