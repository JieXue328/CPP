Builder Pattern
* Builder pattern in useful when you want to build a complex object. Intent of this pattern is to separate the construction of object from its representation.

* It is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object.

* Abstract the construction of object and then derived concrete implementations will give respective construction parts.

* The director makes sure that the product (complex object) is properly created using the builder interface and the parts are built with correct order.

**Advantages**:
1. Allows you to vary a productâ€™s internal representation.
2. Encapsulates code for construction and representation.
3. Provides control over steps of construction process.

**Disadvantages**:
1. Requires creating a separate ConcreteBuilder for each different type of Product.
2. Requires the builder classes to be mutable.
3. Data members of class aren't guaranteed to be initialized. Provides control over steps of construction process.
4. Dependency injection may be less supported.

#### Builder Pattern is uaually comprised of 4 parts:
1) **Product**:     
The product class defines the type of the complex object that is to be generated by the builder pattern.     
2) **Builder**:   
This abstract base class defines all of the steps that must be taken in order to correctly create a product.
3) **ConcreteBuilder**:     
There may be any number of concrete builder classes inheriting from Builder. These classes contain the functionality to create a particular complex product.
4) **Director**:     
The director class controls the algorithm that generates the final product object. A director object is instantiated and its Construct method is called.
