### Definition
The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

The object which is being watched is called the **subject**. The objects which are watching the state changes are called observers or listeners.

Observer pattern uses three actor classes. **Subject**, **Observer** and **Client**. 


### Class inheritance vs type inheritance
* Class inheritance defines an object's implementation in terms of another object's implementation.    
* Type inheritance describes when an object can be used in place of another.
