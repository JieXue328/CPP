1. Use **structures** to store different types of data.
2. '**static**' is used to make access to any data variable or function without making an object of that class. It means that 'static' is used so that we can access any data variable or function without making an object of that class.
3. Need for Initialization List
If we declare any variable as **const**, then that variable can be initialized, but not assigned.
